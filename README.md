# Rule_Engine-with-AST

## Description
A Rule Engine is a software component that allows users to define, manage, and execute business rules and logic in a flexible and scalable manner. This type of engine is commonly used in various applications, such as decision-making systems, workflow automation, and data processing. One of the key features of a Rule Engine is its ability to interpret and evaluate rules defined in a structured format, often represented using Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs).
